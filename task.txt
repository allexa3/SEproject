Distributed Image Processing Platform
Concept
The platform allows users to upload images to perform operations such as applying filters, compressing, resizing. Instead of processing everything on a single server, tasks are distributed across multiple worker nodes in Azure, allowing for faster, scalable, and fault-tolerant image processing.
Each uploaded image is queued for processing, and the results are returned to the user once all transformations are complete.
 
 How It Uses Your Stack
1. C# / .NET — Core Logic & Web Backend(Main Framework)
•	Build the main web application and API that handles:
o	User uploads
o	Authentication
o	Task submission
o	Result retrieval
•	The backend controls job assignment to the distributed worker nodes.
•	Image-processing functions (e.g., filters, transformations) are implemented in C# using libraries like System.Drawing or ImageSharp.
Example:
When a user uploads an image, the .NET API validates it, stores metadata in a database, and sends a message to the processing queue.

2. Azure — Cloud Infrastructure
•	Azure Blob Storage: Stores original and processed images.
•	Azure Queue or Service Bus: Distributes jobs (e.g., “apply grayscale filter”) to worker nodes.
•	Azure Functions / Virtual Machines / Containers: Host worker services that process the queued jobs in parallel.
Scalability:
Azure can automatically scale up workers during high load (e.g., many users uploading at once).

3. WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) — Distributed Communication
•	WCF services connect the central coordinator (main API) with the worker nodes.
•	Allows remote procedure calls so the central app can ask a worker node to perform an image-processing operation.
•	Provides fault handling, timeouts, and load balancing for distributed operations.
Example:
When a new task arrives, the WCF service sends it to the least busy worker node.

4. TPL (Task Parallel Library) — Parallel Image Processing
•	Inside each worker node, TPL is used to run multiple processing tasks concurrently.
•	For example, one worker could apply several filters in parallel or process several user images at the same time.
Example:
Parallel.ForEach() could apply multiple transformations (resize, sharpen, watermark) on one image efficiently.

5. Azure Key Vault (Security Layer) — Secure Key & Data Management
To ensure security and data protection, integrate Azure Key Vault:
•	Stores API keys, connection strings, and encryption keys safely.
•	Manages access control so only authorized components (e.g., the backend API or worker nodes) can access secrets.
•	Supports automatic rotation of keys and certificates.
•	Ensures that no sensitive credentials are hard-coded in code or configuration files.
Example:
The image-processing workers retrieve encryption keys securely from Key Vault to encrypt/decrypt image data before uploading or downloading from Blob Storage.

 End-to-End Flow Summary
1.	User uploads image → Web app (C#/.NET)
2.	Image stored → Azure Blob Storage
3.	Task added → Azure Queue / Service Bus
4.	Task picked up → WCF service sends job to available worker
5.	Worker processes image → Uses TPL for concurrent filters
6.	Processed image saved → Back to Azure Blob
7.	Keys and credentials → Managed securely in Azure Key Vault
8.	User retrieves result → Secure link to processed image
